# Employee_Tracker

## Description 

(This application is not currently finished, but I am writing as if it were).

This is a command line application that will allow you to view, add, or update departments, roles, or employees from a database. After you install the necessary NPM packages, you can run "npm start" in your command terminal and Inquirer will prompt you. Simply choose what you want to do! Have fun!
